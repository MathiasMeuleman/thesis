\chapter{Extrapolation}



Why is extrapolation relevant for wind energy?

The extrapolation technique is used in the IEC 61400-1 for onshore- \cite{Eolica2005} and in IEC 61400-3 \cite{Store2007} for offshore wind turbine design.

relevance:
Extrapolation of 50 years test usaly dictates the load values.
-) A lot of unceirtainty in calculations
